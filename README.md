### Newsletter Marketing Campaign
Mailchimp email marketing was used generate an email signup form for the footer. This free service allows the site owner to manage, run and analyse the success of their newsletter marketing campaign by following the simple steps on the mailchimp site to generate an email form.

### SEO
In order to improve the sites search engine ranking two important files were added to the project :

A sitemap.xml file This file was added to help speed up content discovery for search engines when they crawl and index the web applications.
A robots.txt file This fil was added to acknowledge that search engines are allowed on the site and that they may have free access to it. A robots.txt file is a simple text file that tells search engines where they are not allowed to go on a website. It lists out any folders or files that will not be crawled or indexed by search engine spiders.
